STRICT RULES:
- Output is validated as a JSON object with EXACTLY these ${KEYS.length} keys. Translate the VALUES only; never change the keys.
- Preserve EXACTLY any ICU placeholders in curly braces like {amount}, {count}, {name} — do not translate or reorder their contents.
- Preserve EXACTLY any markup tags like <strong>...</strong>, <a>...</a>, <b>...</b> — translate the text inside but keep the tags.
- Keep brand names (Stripe, PayPal, GloriaFood) untranslated. Keep literal token prefixes (pk_test_, sk_live_, etc.) unchanged.
- Output raw characters, NOT HTML entities (write < and > and & and ' directly, never &lt; &gt; &amp; &#39;).
- Tone: concise, professional, matching a modern SaaS dashboard / customer ordering UI.
